<h2>What is Stream Climb?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>We offer tools to make it easy to find new streamers, watch your favourites
	and promote your own stream.
	</ul>

<h2>What is the Top 12?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Streamers can rent each block to promote their stream.
	<li>At this time only Twitch streams are supported.
	</ul>

<h2>How does Top 12 work?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Anyone can purchase any block at any time.
	<li>Buy 1 or buy them all.
	<li>Enter the Twitch ID of the streamer in the checkout Notes.
	<li>After each purchase, the price increases by 100%.
	<li>This is done to keep the initial prices low to allow smaller streamers
	to promote themselves. (Organic growth vs. fixed growth)
	<li>It also allows Stream Climb to make revenue to support the infrastructure 
	and development of our web site.
	<li>It also allows Stream Climb to offer a refund, to make the Top 12 
	accessable to all.
	<li>Limits spamming
	</ul>

<h2>What if someone buys my block?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Their stream will now appear on that block.
	<li>You will recieve 100% of your purchase price refunded.
	</ul>
<h2>Is Stream Climb a Pyramid/Ponzi scheme?</h2>
	Nope. You are paying for the use of a digital advertising space for
 	an undefined period of time. The refund comes from advertising revenue 
	that each visitor brings to Streamclimb.com and NOT from future purchases. 
	All refunds occur on the 15th of the month, if your block was purchased after
	the 15th, it will occur on the 15th of the following month.'
